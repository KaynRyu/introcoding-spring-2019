# Installing Python 3.7

We will use the Anaconda package curated by Continuum Analytics and that has lots of data science packages.

## Step 1: Download the anaconda installer

If you have a windows machine go to: <https://www.anaconda.com/download/#windows>

If you have a mac go to: <https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos>

## Step 2: Install Anaconda

Double click on the installer and follow the steps. When asked, I highly suggest installing VS Code, which is a powerful editor with autocomplition, debugging capabilities, etc.

## Step 3: Open Anaconda Navigator

* In Windows go to the start up menu in the bottom left corner of the screen and then click on the Anaconda Navigator.

* In Macs go to Applications and double click on the Anaconda Navigator. Alternatively you can use the search bars (in Mac press Command + Space bar).

*JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook*: We will write most of our code in notebooks ideal for reproducible research.

*VS Code*: A powerful and modern code editor. You can download it and code here if you want.

*Spyder*: a graphical user interface similar to that of Matlab.
