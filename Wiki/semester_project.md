# Semester Project Instructions

The semester project consists of creating a Python program that solves a specific problem or executes a specific task. The project may consist of more than one function or python file.

## Project Rules
    
* Projects are individual

* Projects need to be hosted in a public repository in your Github account

* Projects must have a summary written in Markdown

* Function/s documentation must be written using Python comments

* Equations have to be written in LaTeX

* Code must be Python 3

* Draft project summary (only components 1-4) is due on: **31-Jan-2019 14:30**

* Revised project summary is due on: **7-Feb-2019 at 14:30**

* Projects are due on: **2-May-2019 at 17:00**

## Components of project summary

1. Background and rationale (max 150 words)
2. Objective of the code
3. Sketch
4. Pseudocode
5. Provide tentaitve list of state variables, functions, and modules
6. References

## Project mid-semester oral presentation

Students need to make a 5-minute presentation explaining:

* Goal and rationale of the project
* Project diagram/sketch/flowchart/
* Current progress and roadblocks

The goal of the mid-term presentation is to gain feedback from the instructor and classmates.
I highly encourage you to start coding the barebones of your project before the mid-term presentation,
so that you can identify roadblocks.


## Project final oral presentation

Students will need to make a 10-min presentation showcasing the project. 
The presentation must include:

1. A maximum of 5 slides for:
    * background, rationale, and objective
    * project diagram/sketch/flowchart
    * main tools, modules, libraries used in the project
    * required inputs and project outputs
    * challenges that you faced while creating the project and how you solved the problems
    
3. Live demonstration of the code with an example 

## Grading

The final grade for your project will be based on:

* Creativity
* Clear rationale and problem statement
* Attention to detail in documentation, figures, presentations
* Project complexity. This is probably the hardest point to get right. The project should not be too simple and not too complicated. The project needs to make use of multiple concepts covered in class, explore new tools, while ensuring that it can be accomplished during the semester.
