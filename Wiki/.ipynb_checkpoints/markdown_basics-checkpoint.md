# Project: Thermal Time App

## Rationale
Thermal time is a temperature-based variable intimately linked to biological processes. The main advantage of thermal time is that provides a new scale for measuring biological time, that is independent of calendar time. The calculation of thermal time is often carried out using an MS Excel spreadsheet.

The objective of this project was to create a short Python function to automate the computation of thermal time for different mesonet stations.

**Note**: *When working with daily data, thermal time is also known as growing degree days.*

## Method

## Inputs
- Maxium air temperature
- Minimum air temperature
- Based temperature

## Outputs
- Thermal time

Markdown: Basics
================

This page offers a brief overview of what it's like to use Markdown.
The [syntax page] [s] provides complete, detailed documentation for
every feature, but Markdown should be very easy to pick up simply by
looking at a few examples of it in action. The examples on this page
are written in a before/after style, showing example syntax and the
HTML output produced by Markdown.

It's also helpful to simply try Markdown out; the [Dingus] [d] is a
web application that allows you type your own Markdown-formatted text
and translate it to XHTML.

**Note:** This document is itself written using Markdown; you
can [see the source for it by adding '.text' to the URL] [src].

## Paragraphs, Headers, Blockquotes ##

A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated
by one or more blank lines. (A blank line is any line that looks like a
blank line -- a line containing nothing spaces or tabs is considered
blank.) Normal paragraphs should not be intended with spaces or tabs.

To create an atx-style header, you put 1-6 hash marks (`#`) at the
beginning of the line -- the number of hashes equals the resulting
HTML header level.

Blockquotes are indicated using email-style '`>`' angle brackets.



### Phrase Emphasis ###

Markdown uses asterisks and underscores to indicate spans of emphasis.

Markdown:

    Some of these words *are emphasized*.
    Some of these words _are emphasized also_.
    
    Use two asterisks for **strong emphasis**.
    Or, if you prefer, __use two underscores instead__.
   


## Lists ##

Unordered (bulleted) lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens (`*`,
`+`, and `-`) as list markers. These three markers are
interchangable; this:

    *   Candy.
    *   Gum.
    *   Booze.

this:

    +   Candy.
    +   Gum.
    +   Booze.

and this:

    -   Candy.
    -   Gum.
    -   Booze.

all produce the same output:

    <ul>
    <li>Candy.</li>
    <li>Gum.</li>
    <li>Booze.</li>
    </ul>

Ordered (numbered) lists use regular numbers, followed by periods, as
list markers:

    1.  Red
    2.  Green
    3.  Blue

Output:

    <ol>
    <li>Red</li>
    <li>Green</li>
    <li>Blue</li>
    </ol>

If you put blank lines between items, you'll get `<p>` tags for the
list item text. You can create multi-paragraph list items by indenting
the paragraphs by 4 spaces or 1 tab:

    *   A list item.
    
        With multiple paragraphs.

    *   Another item in the list.

Output:

    <ul>
    <li><p>A list item.</p>
    <p>With multiple paragraphs.</p></li>
    <li><p>Another item in the list.</p></li>
    </ul>
    


### Links ###

Markdown supports two styles for creating links: *inline* and
*reference*. With both styles, you use square brackets to delimit the
text you want to turn into a link.

Inline-style links use parentheses immediately after the link text.
For example:

    This is an [example link](http://example.com/).

Output:

    <p>This is an <a href="http://example.com/">
    example link</a>.</p>

Optionally, you may include a title attribute in the parentheses:

    This is an [example link](http://example.com/ "With a Title").

Output:

    <p>This is an <a href="http://example.com/" title="With a Title">
    example link</a>.</p>

Reference-style links allow you to refer to your links by names, which
you define elsewhere in your document:

    I get 10 times more traffic from [Google][1] than from
    [Yahoo][2] or [MSN][3].

    [1]: http://google.com/        "Google"
    [2]: http://search.yahoo.com/  "Yahoo Search"
    [3]: http://search.msn.com/    "MSN Search"

The title attribute is optional. Link names may contain letters,
numbers and spaces, but are *not* case sensitive:

    I start my morning with a cup of coffee and
    [The New York Times][NY Times].

    [ny times]: http://www.nytimes.com/

### Images ###

Image syntax is very much like link syntax.

Inline (titles are optional):

    ![alt text](/path/to/img.jpg "Title")

Reference-style:

    ![alt text][id]

    [id]: /path/to/img.jpg "Title"

### Code ###

In a regular paragraph, you can create code span by wrapping text in
backtick quotes. Any ampersands (`&`) and angle brackets (`<` or
`>`) will automatically be translated into HTML entities. This makes
it easy to use Markdown to write about HTML example code:

    I strongly recommend against using any `<blink>` tags.

    I wish SmartyPants used named entities like `&mdash;`
    instead of decimal-encoded entites like `&#8212;`.


To specify an entire block of pre-formatted code, indent every line of
the block by 4 spaces or 1 tab. Just like with code spans, `&`, `<`,
and `>` characters will be escaped automatically.

Markdown:

    If you want your page to validate under XHTML 1.0 Strict,
    you've got to put paragraph tags in your blockquotes:

        <blockquote>
            <p>For example.</p>
        </blockquote>
