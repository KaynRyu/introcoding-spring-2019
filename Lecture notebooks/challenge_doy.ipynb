    "> **Note** that adding a unit in `doy_float` makes sense if you just want to know the DOY in integer format. In its current state, the code will return `DOY=1` for `1-jan`, which is what we expect.\n",
    "However, if we want the fraction of DOY to make sense, then we need to skip the summation of a unit. So, that `1-jan at noon` returns `0.5`. I would go with the first approach, since often times we just need the integer value between 1 and 365 (or 366 for leap years)."
