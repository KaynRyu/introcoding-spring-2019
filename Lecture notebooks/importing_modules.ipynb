    "Modules are just files containing specialized python code.Modules (a.k.a packages, toolboxes) are a collection of lines of code, typically in the form of functions) that you can bring up into the Python interpreter to execute a specific operation. There are tons of modules and to avoid loading every module in your local environment Python works by calling the modules that we need to use. Of course, this means that somehow we need to learn which are the modules available. This is usually something that you learn in a coding class, looking at the documentation, or by simply searching in the web.\n",
